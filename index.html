                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Winchester Family are Men of Letters and hunters. The Winchester bloodline goes back to their ancestors Cain and Abel. Mary Winchester comes from a family of hunters, while the Winchester line was traditionally Men of Letters. Sam and Dean Winchester were destined to be the vessels of Archangel Michael and Lucifer.

                        He is the oldest son of John and Mary, the older brother of Sam, and the older paternal half-brother of Adam. He is one of the members of the Winchester family. He was raised into hunting by his father, John. From birth, he was destined to be the vessel of the Archangel Michael

                        He is the youngest son of John and Mary. He is the younger brother of Dean and the older paternal half-brother of Adam. He is one of the three surviving members of the Winchester family. His father, John, hadn't brought him into hunting right away like his older brother, Dean. Instead, he had to find out who his family was the hard way and eventually was forced to go into "The Family Business". From birth, he was destined to be the vessel of the Archangel Lucifer
