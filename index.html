                        Winchester Family History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Winchester Family are Men of Letters and hunters.
                        The Winchester bloodline goes back to their ancestors
                        Cain and Abel. Mary Winchester comes from a family of
                        hunters, while the Winchester line was traditionally Men
                        of Letters. Sam and Dean Winchester were destined to be
                        the vessels of Archangel Michael and Lucifer.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        He is the oldest son of John and Mary, the older brother
                        of Sam, and the older paternal half-brother of Adam. He
                        is one of the members of the Winchester family. He was
                        raised into hunting by his father, John. From birth, he
                        was destined to be the vessel of the Archangel Michael
                    </p>

                        He is the youngest son of John and Mary. He is the
                        younger brother of Dean and the older paternal
                        half-brother of Adam. He is one of the three surviving
                        members of the Winchester family. His father, John,
                        hadn't brought him into hunting right away like his
                        older brother, Dean. Instead, he had to find out who his
                        family was the hard way and eventually was forced to go
                        into "The Family Business". From birth, he was destined
                        to be the vessel of the Archangel Lucifer

                        <p>
                            "Et secta diabolica, omnis congregatio, omnis legio, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis spiritus, exorcizamus!"
                            This incantation is said to keep the Demon from escaping the host, and being locked in until excorcism is ready to be initiated.
